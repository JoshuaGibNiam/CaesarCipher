# Caesar Cipher Encoding & Decoding

This is a simple program of a caesar cipher, created by me months ago.
It prompts the user for a choice to encode or decode, then prompts for 
the message.

---

## Caesar Cipher Explanation
1. The program asks if the user wants to encode or decode a message.
2. The user enters a shift value (the number of positions each letter 
will be shifted in the alphabet).
3. If encoding, letters are shifted forward in the alphabet.
4. If decoding, letters are shifted backward in the alphabet.
5. The encoded/decoded message is displayed.
6. The user is prompted to repeat the process or exit the program.

## Features
1. Supports encoding and decoding
2. Handles uppercase and lowercase letters.
3. Maintains non-alphabetic letters, such as spaces.
4. Allows the user to quit the program.
